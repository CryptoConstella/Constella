The main objective of Proyecto Constella ([www.constella.cl](http://www.constella.cl)) is to educate chilean population about the use of cryptocurrencies by proposing a reliable, open, and decentralized monetary system, along with the necessary documentation to easily understand the functioning of the network and the used technology.

Official Wallet of [Proyecto Constella](http://constella.cl).
 
## What is this?
 
*ConstellaWallet* is a modified client from the [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) (0.13.3) source code, that allows people to communicate with the network of **Proyecto Constella**.
 
With the *ConstellaWallet* you will be able to send and receive *Constellas* (`XCL`), which is the cryptocurrency used in this network.
 
## Why the name "ConstellaWallet"?
 
In Chile is common calling "*constellawallet*" to a little purse used to keep coins, and given that the cryptocurrency is called *Constella*, the normal thing was calling the wallet *ConstellaWallet*.
 
## Information of the Constella network:
 
- Every minute *Constellas* are generated as a reward of mining a block.
- With the first block **50.000 XCL** were generated for the financing of the project.
- Since block `#1` to `#2833` the reward was of **10 XCL** per block.
- From the `#2834` block to the `#50000` block the reward is variable.
- From the `#50000` block onwards, the reward is the **10 XCL** for block, divided in 2 every 2 years approximately.
- The difficulty of the mining of each block is dynamically recalculated from the 147000 block by using DGW.
- The maximum of *Constellas* that will exist in the network is `10.800.000 XCL`.
- The PMC1 proposal defined the generation in 1.5 XCL and the Halving in 5 years from the `#220000` block
- The *Constella* network is based on [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/).
